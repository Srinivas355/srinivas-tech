Introduction to Power BI 

What is Power BI?

Power BI is a Reporting Software
Power BI is a Data Visualization Software 
Power BI is a Data Analytics Software 
Power BI is a Business Intelligence(BI) Software

Who will use Power BI Software ?
Who will Hire Power BI Developer / Data Analyst ?

Any Company - Business  - Business Data  - Store Data Sources  -  Analyze the Business Data  - Power BI - Power BI Developer

We will Analyze the Business Data  by Generating Reports / Visuals 

-------------------------
Power BI Developer Need to Implement the Business Intelligence (BI) Process to Analyze the Companies Business Data 

---------------
Business Intelligence (BI) is a Process which Converts Business Data into Actionable Information 

OLTP(S)		ETL		OLAP		Create Reports / Visuals 		Share Reports / Visuals with Clients 
Business Data			Analysis 		Actionable Information

The Place where Companies Stores Business Data  / Transactional Data  we call as OLTP System 
OLTP – Online Transactional  Processing

Note: OLTP Databases are not Recommended for Analysis (Create Reports / Visuals )

OLAP – Online Analytical  Processing

To move Data from OLTP Database to OLAP Database we need ETL Software 

ETL – Extract, Transform & Load

***  Transform  - Converting the data from One Format to Anottther Format we call as Transform (INR - $)

-----------------------

Install Power BI Desktop Software 

---------------------

Power BI Desktop

Power BI Desktop is a Developemnt Softwarre in Power BI.

Power BI Desktop is used to Prepare the Data , Model the Data & Visualize the Data 

Prepare the Data 	- ETL Activities  	- Power Query
Model the Data	- OLAP Model	- Power Pivot
Visualize the Data 	- Create Visuals 	 - Power View 

-------------------------------
Overview of Power Query Software 

Power Query is an ETL Software in Power BI 

Power Query can Connect & Extract the Data from almost any Kind of Data Source, Transform the Data as per the Reporting Needs and Loads the Data into Power Pivot .

OLTP(S) / Data Sources  - Excel, SQL Server 

1. Data Sources 
2. What information we need to Show in Reports / Visuals 


Home Tab - Transform Data - Power Query Editor User Interface (UI) - ETL Activities 

ETL – Extract, Transform & Load

Power Query Editor User Interface (UI) - 100's GUI Options - ETL Activities

GUI - Graphical User Interface Options 

----------------------
Behind Every GUI option Microsoft already Written the Code 

When we use the GUI Options Code will Execute and will Provide the Result 

GUI Options - Code - M( Mashup) Language 

----------------------------------------------------------

Class 3

Overview of Power Pivot Software

Power Pivot is a Inmemory Columnar Database which is used for creating an OLAP Model 

Database  is used to Store the Data in the Form of Tables 

1. Relational Databases / Tradational Databases 
Eg: Oracle, SQL Server etc.,

When we Access the Data from Relational Databases / Tradational Databases they will Process Data from Hard Disk 


2. InMemory Databases 
Eg: Power Pivot , SAP HANA etc.,

When we Do Reporting on InMemory Databases , they will Give Better Performance then Relational Databases / Tradational Databases

When we Access the Data from InMemory Databases they will Process Data from RAM 


In Power Pivot Data will Be Highly Compressed because of Columnar Format 

SQL Server (100 GB)		Power Pivot (Approx 10 GB)
Row Format			Columnar Format 

-----------------------------------------------
As a Power BI Developer in Power Pivot we will Perform 2 Activities 

1. Data Modeling 
***2. Enhancing the Data Model ( DAX Language )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Modeling  - Establishing the Relationships Between tables we call as  Data Modeling 

Power BI have Intelligence to Do Majority of Data Modeling Work by itself 

What is the Need of Data Modeling?
What is the need of Establishing the Relationships Between tables?

When ever we need to Create Visuals using More than One Tables we need to have Relationships Between tables

Majority of Cases clients will Ask us to Create Visuals using More than One Tables 

Data Modeling Work can be Done in Model View 

------------------

 Enhancing the Data Model ( DAX Language )

With the Data Model we can Show Only 70 to 80% of Information what Clients are asking to Show  in the Visuals 

All the Times what information Clients are asking to Show in the Visuals it will not be radily Available in Data Model ( Tables )

Clients will ask us to Some New Information / Additional Information in the Visuals which is not available in Tables 


 Enhancing the Data Model  - Creating New Information using Existing Information we call as  Enhancing the Data Model 

New Information - Existing Information + DAX Language

Enhancing the Data Model  - Creating New Information using Existing Information we call as  Enhancing the Data Model 

New Information - Existing Information + DAX Language (Functions + Operators )

DAX  - Data Analysis eXpressions Language  - Functional Language 

DAX Language  - Functions + Operators 

--

Enhancing the Data Model  can be Done in Data View

Data View - Select the table where we nneed to Create New Information - Table Tools - Calculations - New Information 

3 Types New Information  

1. Columns	- New Column
2. Measures	- New Measure / Quick Measure
3. Tables 	- New Table

New Information - Columns , Measures & Tables - DAX Formulas / DAX Expressions - Existing Information + DAX Functions + DAX Operators 

---------------------
When to Create Columns?

In a Table for Every Row if we need a Calculation we will Create Columns 

------------------------
When to Create Measures?

When ever we need to Perform Aggregate Calculations, Percentages we will Create Measures 

In a Table for Group of Rows if we need a Calculation we will Create Measures 

-----------
Tables  

Date Dimension Tables , Aggregate Tables , Filtered tables 

-----------------------------------------------
What You will Perform in Power Query?

ETL Activities 

--------------------------------------
What You will Perform in Power Pivot?

Data Modeling 
Enhancing the Data Model ( DAX Language )

Prepare a Dataset(OLAP) 

What a Dataset will Contains ?

Dataset - Tables + Relationships Between the Tables + New Information (DAX) - 100 % Information in the Visuals 


-------------------------------------------
Power Query	- Transform Data		- ETL Activities
Power Pivot	- Model View + Data View	- Dataset
Power View	- Report View		- Create Visuals 


--------------------------------------------

To the Power BI Report we can Add the Data in two Ways 

1. Power Query 			- New Source 

		Ok 	- Selected Tables will get into Power Query	
		Cancel	- Connection to Data Source wiill Lost


2. Power Pivot / Power View	 - Get Data

		Load		- Selected Tables will Load into Power Pivot 
		Transform Data 	- Tables will Open in Power Query 
		Cancel		- Connection to Data Source wiill Lost	

--------------------------------------
Class 5 

Overview of Power View Software

Power View is used to Create Visuals by Taking Dataset as Source 

Graphical Representation of data we call as Visuals 

Report View is the Place where we will Create the Visuals 

------------

Total Qunatity Sold 

Report Canvas is the place we will Build Visuals 

When we Add the Visual to Report Canvas we will get Below 3 Sections

1. Fields Section
2. Format Section
3. Analytics Section

With the Help of the 3 Sections we will Complete the Development of the Visuals 

Below the Fileds Section we will Have Field Wells . Field Wells are the Place where we need to Drag Columns 

Visual to Visual the Number of Field Wells will Vary 

Total Qunatity Sold 
Total Sales Amount 
Total Profit Amount

Create a Visual to Show Category Wise Sales 
Create a Visual to Show Category Wise Profits
